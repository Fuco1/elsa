* Narrowing (type guards)

The general type narrowing analysis works as follows:

1. During analysis of a function call, determine if the function
   narrows the type of any variable passed in as an argument
2. Set this type on the function call form as =narrow-types=
3. If later this form is found in a condition (=if=, =cond= etc.), we can
   use the =narrow-types= to narrow the type of the variable /in the
   branch which evaluates when condition is true/.  For the false
   branch, we can use the diff type (anything except the narrowed
   type).

Narrowing can be set on a function statically by setting
=elsa-narrow-types= on the function symbol as a positional list
(i.e. type after narrowing of nth input variable) or dynamically
during analysis by setting the form's =narrow-types= to a list of
=elsa-variable= items.
